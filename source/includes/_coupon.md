# coupon
Coupon represents store promotions or discounts codes created through Capillary Campaign Manager. A single campaign can contain one or more coupons or coupon series. Coupons are issued to loyalty or non-loyalty customers through SMS or email.

You cannot create new coupons using coupon APIs; instead, you can send or retrieve coupons that are already created in your campaigns. Hence, it is important to note the coupon code, coupon id or coupon series id for making API calls.
