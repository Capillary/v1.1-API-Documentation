# Points
Points represent loyalty points of an organization that are issued to the loyalty customers based on the transactions made and tiers achieved. Customers can redeem the loyalty points earned by them against transactions. Points are issued only through the Loyalty Manager upon a transaction or tier upgrade but not through API calls.

The points entity allows you to perform the following tasks:

* Check whether a specific number of points can be redeemed by a customer  
* Validate customerâ€™s mobile number by issuing validation code to redeem points 
* Redeem loyalty points of a customer after validating the preceding tasks

## Check If Points are Redeemable
